"ImageViewer" is an ultra-minimalistic image viewing program 
for Windows originally built with C and SDL2 by Introscopia in 2020. 
This latest (2025-03-23) update brings this little program to SDL3 and to 64 bits!
It supports webp again, animations, and now sports multi-image capabilities:
Just drag-and-drop image files onto the window!

Uses OK_LIB: https://github.com/brackeen/ok-lib
